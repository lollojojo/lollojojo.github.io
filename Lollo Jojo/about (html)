        <p>Hi! I'm Lollo, a second year college student and the author behind this blog. Apart from writing, I enjoy reading, traveling and spending time in nature, swiming, walking and hiking. 
          I started this blog to share about student, and freetime, life as well as anything else that comes up. 
        I'm glad you found your way here, and hope you find this enjoyable to read. Since I also coded this blog from scratch, my first real project ever, you might come accross some
      problems. If you do, than please contact me via the "Contact" button and I will try to fix it.
    Otherwise feel free to click around and read whatever you feel like reading, and also check out my instagra, by pressing the icon below.
